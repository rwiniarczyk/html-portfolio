<h1>About Me</h1>

<img src="Robin pic.jpg"/>

<p>I have been a registered nurse since 1983 with a passion for providing all patients with an exceptional customer experience and the best clinical outcomes. Throughout my years in the medical field I often witness opportunities to streamline processes which leads to customer satisfaction as well as business efficiencies. In the post-COVID landscape it is imperative to remain as lean as possible but to not ignore what is most important, the patient. </p>

<p>In 2022 I embarked on a new endeavor which pairs medicine, quality improvement, process improvement, and Lean principles to work with healthcare organizations to focus on positive patient experiences and efficiencies. Today, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) dictates more and more requirements for reimbursement; however, these requirements often negatively impact the amount of time that a healthcare provider can spend focusing on patient concerns during an office visit. My goal is simple, partnering with medical offices and providers to seamlessly incorporate CMS requirements into a patient visit while ensuring adeqate time for patient concerns and questions. Web development is a tool that can effectively be utilized in this process.</p>
